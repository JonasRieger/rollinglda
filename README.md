## Construct Consistent Time Series from Textual Data
RollingLDA is a rolling version of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation. By an sequential approach, it enables the construction of LDA-based time series of topics that are consistent with previous states of LDA models. After an initial modeling, updates can be computed efficiently, allowing for real-time monitoring and detection of events or structural breaks.
